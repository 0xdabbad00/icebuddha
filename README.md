Summary
=======
IceBuddha a hex-viewer and generic binary file parser (similar to 010 editor by SweetScape: http://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/).  Really though, it's just a toy project to see how far HTML5 can be taken to develop an entirely in-browser, client-side webapp. No server component exists except to serve static web pages.

SlopFinder
----------
The sub-project SlopFinder is a greatly simplified set of the functionality of IceBuddha for the sole purpose of identifying if Windows executables have DEP and ASLR enabled in them.
