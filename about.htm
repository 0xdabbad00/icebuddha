			<p><h2>Motive</h2>
			The goal of IceBuddha is to become a general purpose binary file parser to help me learn some things and try out some ideas.  I'm doing this because I think it's an interesting idea, and with no goal of financial gain (just street cred).

			<p><h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
			I don't collect any data. Everything is happening locally, client side on your system. It's all javascript and html, so I invite you to not only review my code on <a href="https://github.com/0xdabbad00/icebuddha">github</a>, but host this site locally.  Or better yet, fork it and send me fixes/features!  Most of the site should work by just downloading it and browsing to it on your local hard-drive, even without a web server (some code does currently grab files from my server but I'm trying to figure out a smarter way to handle that).  I host this site on amazon EC2 because most free hosting tracks users.  I believe strongly in privacy, and frankly I'm too stupid to know how to profit from your use of this site.

			<p>I do want to eventually incorporate some wiki capabilities into this site which will mean some server side code, but I still will refrain from sending home any data you are not specifically requesting my server receive.
